**Today's Progress**: Started writing in the movement controls of Tekken 7 for PC, Xbox One, and PS4

**Thoughts:** I had fun coding in the movement controls of Tekken 7 for PC, Xbox One, and the PS4. My first approach of using images to show the controls didn't work out. So, I am just going to show it in text within the <ul> and <li> tags. Maybe tomorrow I will do that.

### R1D55: November 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "What you should already have" section of the guide

**Thoughts:** It feels great to be back coding after one long break from doing this. I am researching on what to add in my Tekken 7 guide from a variety of sources. Watching YouTube videos, reading Tekken 7 guides, and absorbing the basic stuff.

### R1D54: October 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished some dark theme CSS code and added custom scroll bars

**Thoughts:** I had a little too much fun with the scroll bars and the dark theme of the documentation. It went pretty well and it also looks great! I was planning to add a dark mode and light mode switch. But, it was too much work to deal with so I scraped it.

### R1D53: October 14, 2019
I managed to code today even inside my rather hectic schedule of school activities. I only changed one thing due to the lack of time today, which is the text color of the documentation. https://codepen.io/Micmix03/details/oNvOjar
