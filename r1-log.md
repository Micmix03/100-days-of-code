### R1D54: October 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished some dark theme CSS code and added custom scroll bars

**Thoughts:** I had a little too much fun with the scroll bars and the dark theme of the documentation. It went pretty well and it also looks great! I was planning to add a dark mode and light mode switch. But, it was too much work to deal with so I scraped it.

### R1D53: October 14, 2019
I managed to code today even inside my rather hectic schedule of school activities. I only changed one thing due to the lack of time today, which is the text color of the documentation. https://codepen.io/Micmix03/details/oNvOjar
